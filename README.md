# Intro to Programming Final Project - Pocket Football by Matt Mlawski

* Mini-version of a football game where the player is on offense against the computer
* Player has options for choosing their team, opponent, kickoff play, and whether to pass or run
* Start on first down, must get to the yard to gain in order to keep playing
* Watch out, you can fumble the ball or get intercepted and lose
* If you score a touchdown, you win!
* Look out for a tiny egg in the game where you automatically win :)
